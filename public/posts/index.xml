            <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad to announce that when the basic tutorial series will be over, I&amp;rsquo;ll add a plugin called Disqus, which will allow you on all my posts and tutorials to comment and let me know your thoughts and advices (or doubts if something wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear). The other new is that an extra episode about other little things I might have left and that will improve our project. By the way I will create a GitHub repository that will store all the projects made here.</description>

The other new is that an extra episode about other little things I might have left and that will improve our project. By the way I will create a GitHub repository that will store all the projects made here. On the Website itself will be a dedicated page that will contain also extra links, tutorials and other stuff you might find useful.
Thank you very much for your attention! See you at the next tutorial!</p>
