I'm glad to announce that when the basic tutorial series will be over, I'll add a plugin called [Disqus](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/#add-disqus), which will allow you on all my posts and tutorials to comment and let me know your thoughts and advices (or doubts if something wasn't clear). The other new is that an extra episode about other little things I might have left and that will improve our project. By the way I will create a GitHub repository that will store all the projects made here. On the Website itself will be a dedicated page that will contain also extra links, tutorials and other stuff you might find useful.
Thank you very much for your attention! See you at the next tutorial!
