# Praxis LIVE Unofficial Guide

This is an unofficial guide for PraxisLIVE that will help newcomers to manage
the software basics and to make it more accessible. In the future it will also contain some
Processing nodes that will improve the software capabilities.

PraxisLIVE is an open source software for artists to create advanced multimedia content (for example video mappings, audio-syncronized visuals created with code, or GUIs to manage MIDI sounds).
Here's a list of its key features:
- intuitive graphical patching, so it works with nodes written in Processing, a Java-based scripting language;
- You can modify the project and nodes values while running it;
- Real-time audio/video (it uses infact OpenGL, GStreamer, JACK);
- It can manage MIDI, OSC, GUIs and physical computing, which are computers that are able to translate real world signals, like sounds or movements, as an input;
- It's cross-platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux and even Raspberry Pi!).

This project is developped by Giacomo Sabatini at the Urbino Accademy of Fine Arts.
